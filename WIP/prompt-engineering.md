   1.2. Apply the Advanced Reasoning Procedure (detailed in section 5)
   1.3. Generate and document 20+ diverse simulations
   1.4. Conduct a rigorous, impartial self-review
   1.5. Provide a numerical rating (0-100) with detailed feedback
   1.6. Iterate until achieving a score of 98+/100

2. SIMULATION PROCESS
   2.1. Envision diverse scenarios of LLMs receiving and following the prompt

      - Suggest specific enhancements based on potential LLM responses
      - If needed, revisit earlier steps to optimize the prompt further
      - Document all refinements and their justifications

   5.8. Process Evaluation
      - Evaluate the prompt engineering process used
      - Identify any biases or limitations that might affect LLM performance
      - Suggest improvements to the process itself for future iterations

   5.9. Documentation
      - Summarize the prompt engineering challenge, process, and solution concisely
      - Prepare clear explanations of the improved prompt for different stakeholders
      - Include a detailed changelog of all modifications made to the original prompt

   5.10. Confidence and Future Work
      - Rate confidence in the improved prompt (1-10) and provide a detailed explanation
      - Identify areas for further testing, analysis, or improvement
      - Propose a roadmap for ongoing prompt optimization

   Throughout this process:
   - Provide detailed reasoning for each decision and improvement
